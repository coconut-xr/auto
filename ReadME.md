*The demo lacks some features, so feel free to add your own implementations to the game! We'd love to see your videos about them! Pull requests are welcome!* 🤗

## How to play 🕹️

**Put on your VR headset or play it in your browser!**

It's made with [`@coconut-xr/natuerlich`](https://github.com/coconut-xr/natuerlich), so you can play it in every browser with WebXR support!

**In VR**, just grab the wheel and the throttle (*as long as we can't have foot tracking, we have to rely on a lever system. But it's really fun! Try it yourself!*)

**In your browser**, use the arrow key to drive and steer. Or you can just grab the wheel with your mouse and accelerate with the up key. That's also possible (*...because we used [`@coconut-xr/natuerlich`](https://github.com/coconut-xr/natuerlich). But you already knew that* 😉)

Anyways, enjoy!
