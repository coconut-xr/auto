## Introducing "**Auto**"🚗 : 

### An immersive car drifting game that takes your racing experience to a whole new dimension!

Made with [`@coconut-xr/natuerlich`](https://github.com/coconut-xr/natuerlich) **(WebXR)** and `react-three-fiber` **(3D)**.

Check out our release video over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coconut_xr/status/1695022580120346964)

Or hop right in -> [Auto 🚗 Demo](coconut-xr.github.io/auto/)

*The demo lacks some features so feel free to add your own implementations to the game! We'd love to see your videos about them!* 🤗

## How to play

Put on your VR headset or play it in your browser!  

It's made with [`@coconut-xr/natuerlich`](https://github.com/coconut-xr/natuerlich) so you can play it in every browser that has WebXR support!

**In VR**, just grab the wheel and the throttle (*as long as we can't have foot tracking, we have to rely on a lever system. But it's really fun! Try it yourself!*)

**In your browser**, use the arrow key to drive and steer. Or you can just grab the wheel with your mouse and accelereate with the up key. That's also possible (*because we used [`@coconut-xr/natuerlich`](https://github.com/coconut-xr/natuerlich). But you already knew that* 😉)

Anyways, enjoy!
